# Qualitative-Data-Analysis
This repository serves as a container for my Learning Experience Journey in Qualitative Data Analysis.

## The Software: NVivo
This software can either be used thematic analysis or content analysis.

First, I would be trying out the thematic analysis first, since that is what I need for the task at hand (at the moment).

# Task
Text from key findings and future research directions of academic papers are to be analyzed, and see themes yhat emerged during thos iterative process.

# Steps
#1. Get an NVivo software by downloading it.

#2. Get some refresher tutorials.

#3. Prepare the data.

#4. Start analyzing.

# 7 Basic steps of Conducting Manual coding
#1. Assign labels to your research questions.



#2. Using specific coding method(s), code relevant statements and put them under their respective anchor codes.

#3. Compile a list of initial codes.

#4. Arrange them alphabetically and group codes into their respective anchor codes.

#5. Group codes and tally frequency.

#6. Generate categories/themes to address the research questions.

#7. Visualize codes, categories and themes generated


# Let's talk a little bit about the process of generating codes
#Step 1. Having a quick summary of your data first. This you could do my reading through or leveraging any method that works for you to have a quick snapshot of your data.

#Step 2: Read through your text sentence-by-sentence.

#Step 3: Identity the one thing that the sentence represents, and code it in NVivo.

#Step 4: Once done with coding, start categorizing them into themes.

#Step 5: Visualize your themes/codes - Word count might be in order.
